            <p>A blog about confusion, frustration, and a world that seems unrecognizable.</p>

            <h2>Waking Up in a Strange World</h2>
            <p>It feels strange to even be writing this. A few weeks ago, I had no idea I’d even be able to. I woke up, or rather, I *was* woken up, from a coma that lasted 35 years. The year I remember? 1989. The world back then felt simpler, quieter. The Berlin Wall was still standing. The internet didn’t exist the way it does now. And cell phones were the size of bricks, if they existed at all. Life was different. Life was *real*.</p>

            <p>Now? It’s 2024, and I feel like I’ve been dropped into an alternate universe. I don’t even recognize the world I see around me. The people? They seem... distracted. Everyone is staring at their phones. They're *connected*, but they don’t seem to be truly *there*. It's like everyone's living in a digital dream while I’m stuck in some foggy reality I can’t quite reach.</p>

            <div class="quote">
                <p>"I woke up in a world where everyone is staring at their phones. Where did everyone go?"</p>
            </div>

            <h2>The Digital Chaos</h2>
            <p>I can’t wrap my head around this “internet” thing. It’s everywhere. People talk about it like it’s always been around. They have these tiny screens they carry around, and they’re always typing or scrolling through them. I’ve tried to understand it, but it’s like trying to read a book written in a foreign language.</p>

            <p>I’ve been told I can Google things, that I can look up “anything” in an instant, but how is that even possible? When I left, we were still using dial-up connections—if we had internet at all. I don’t know how to process the idea that all this knowledge, all these *connections* are just at the tips of everyone’s fingers.</p>

            <p>Then there's social media. It’s like people are living two lives—one in the real world and another one online. I’ve seen people posting photos of their meals, of their pets, of themselves in places they’ve been. They call it "influencing," and all I can think is, *why?* How did we go from talking face-to-face to posting photos of our lives for strangers? The idea that anyone can be a celebrity based on their “followers”... it’s mind-boggling to me.</p>

            <h2>What Happened to Connection?</h2>
            <p>One of the hardest things to understand is how people seem to be everywhere but with each other. I went to a café the other day and saw couples sitting together, not talking to each other. Instead, they were both glued to their phones. It’s like the world is more connected than ever, but the real connections, the deep, meaningful ones, are fading away.</p>

            <p>So here I am, trying to catch up with a world I don’t belong to anymore. I miss the days when conversations didn’t feel like they were interrupted by notifications. When a simple walk down the street didn’t involve checking a screen every few seconds. But maybe I’m just an old man now, holding on to a past that was never meant to last.</p>

            <div class="quote">
                <p>"I don’t know if I’m more disappointed or just plain *lost* in this new world. Maybe both."</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Trying to Find My Place</h2>
            <p>Some days, I wish I could go back to 1989, when things felt more... human. But then I remember that even then, things weren’t perfect. There were problems, challenges, frustrations. And maybe today is the same—it’s just different. I have to believe that I can still find my place in it, even if it’s going to take some time.</p>

            <p>For now, I’m here, trying to make sense of this digital maze, and figuring out how to live in a world that’s moving faster than I can keep up. But maybe, just maybe, if I take it one step at a time, I’ll find a way to be a part of it. Even if that’s just through my own reflections, my own voice in this vast, overwhelming sea of information.</p>
